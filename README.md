# Droptune Design & Frontend
Design and frontend assets for the [Droptune](https://github.com/Shpigford/droptune) app.

The goal for this repo is to give designers and frontend developers the ability to contribute to the design of Droptune without needing to jump through insane processes for local dev setup just to help out.

## Design
You can find all design files on Figma. Use the Figma files as a starting point.

* **App: https://www.figma.com/file/WEx8hulLya4imOPJ1PPDWBNa/Desktop?node-id=0%3A1**
* **Branding: https://www.figma.com/file/Qdy5RjmZY7850xAiV7CjA6To/Logo?node-id=36%3A25**

### How to contribute to design

1. Start with one of the afformentioned Figma projects.
2. Duplicate the Figma project you're interested in contributing to.
3. Once you're ready to submit something, use [Issues](https://github.com/Shpigford/droptune-design/issues) to submit a link to your Figma project. If it's for an existing issue, please use that.

If the submission is accepted, we'll merge it in to the main Figma files.

## Frontend
The frontend code for Droptune is located in the `buildout` directory. It uses HTML, CSS (w/ Saas) and JavaScript (w/ jQuery). We intentionally have avoided using lots of packages so it's as easy as possible to start contributing.
